.TH ANAGRAM "1" "Version 0.2"
.SH NAME
.B anagram
\- Anagramming utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anagram
.RB [ "letter set" ]
.RB [ "word file" ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B anagram
finds all "anagrams" (permissible word permutations) of a given letter set.
The underscore (_) represents "wild card" letters, analogous to blank tiles in
a familiar commercial word construction board game.
The output is printed to
.I stdout
and may of course be redirected.

Examples:

.I anagram etaoinshrdlu
anagrams "etaoinshrdlu" using the default word list, /usr/dict/word.lst,
as the reference list.

.I anagram rwo_gni
anagrams "rwo (wild card) gni" using the default word list, /usr/dict/word.lst,
as the reference list.

.I anagram abcdefgh /usr/dict/linux.words
anagrams "abcdefgh" using /usr/dict/linux.words as the reference list.

This utility is intended as a tool for word gamers.

.SH OPTIONS
None.


.SH FILES
.B /usr/dict/word.lst

The word list installed from the
.I yawl
package, which is the default list used if none other is specified.
Any alphabetized ASCII list in "standard" form, i.e., one word per line, would
also work.


.SH SEE ALSO
multi(1)


.SH BUGS
The binary search function in
.I anagram.c
could stand some fine tuning.
