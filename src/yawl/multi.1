.TH MULTI "1" "Version 0.2"
.SH NAME
.B multi
\- Multiple word anagramming utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multi
.RB [ "letter set" ]
.RB [ "number of words" ]
.RB [ "word file" ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B multi
finds multiple word "anagrams" (permissible word permutations) of a given
letter set.  The underscore (_) represents "wild card" letters, analogous
to blank tiles in a familiar commercial word construction board game.
The output is printed to
.I stdout
and may of course be redirected.

Examples:

.I multi etaoinshrdlu 2
finds all 2-word anagrams of "etaoinshrdlu" using the default word list,
/usr/dict/word.lst, as the reference list.

.I multi orw_gin 2
finds all 2-word anagrams of "orw (wild card) gin" using the default word list,
/usr/dict/word.lst, as the reference list.

.I multi abcdefgh 3 /usr/dict/linux.words
finds all 3-word anagrams of "abcdefgh" using /usr/dict/linux.words as the reference list.

Note that anagram multiples greater than 3 slow program execution considerably.

.SH OPTIONS
None.


.SH FILES
.B /usr/dict/word.lst
The word list installed from the
.I yawl
package, which is the default list used if none other is specified.
Any alphabetized ASCII list in "standard" form, i.e., one word per line, would
also work.

.B anagram_.xxx
Intermediate files created during program run, but deleted upon termination.



.SH SEE ALSO
anagram(1)


.SH BUGS
Runs too slowly. Optimization and fine tuning needed.
