The TWL98 HTML file has 2 errors in this area: it omits "supermini" from the
"italics" list, and it erroneously calls "latte" an "italics" entry (which
it is not, it is a recent addition as a regular entry).

Also, the MW10 entry for "basset hound", which used to reference "bassett",
has been corrected.  For this reason, "bassett" and its plural, which were
present in the previous edition of ENABLE as "also called" words, have been
removed from ENABLE2K.  A similar correction to "carambola" has resulted in
the removal of "starfruit".
